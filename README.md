# ML Model 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` package manager (usually included with Python)
- Basic command-line knowledge

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing your Flask app code to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flask-app.git
cd your-flask-app
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-flask-app` with the actual repository URL and app folder name.

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Virtual environments help isolate dependencies for different projects. This prevents conflicts between packages.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS and Linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

While in the virtual environment, install the required packages using `pip`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Replace `requirements.txt` with the actual filename if it's different.

## Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, create a `.env` file in the app's root directory and add the necessary variables.

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey
```

Replace the values with your actual configuration.

## Step 5: Run the Flask App

Run the Flask development server.

```bash
flask run
```

By default, the app will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Step 6: Access the App

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see your Flask app in action.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the app, deactivate the virtual environment.

```bash
deactivate
```

## Additional Notes

- For production deployment, consider using a more robust server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
- Always keep your dependencies up to date and follow security best practices.
- Flask's built-in development server is not suitable for production use due to security and performance limitations.

Congratulations, you've successfully set up and run your Flask app on various operating systems! Remember that these instructions are meant to provide a general guideline. Depending on your app's complexity, you might need to make adjustments or follow specific deployment procedures.
